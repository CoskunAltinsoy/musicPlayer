# Music Player

In this application, the user first registers to the system as a user. After registration, the user logs into the system with jwt. The user can follow other users and artists, create playlists and add songs to favorites. To upload songs to the system, the user needs to create an artist request. If the request is approved, the user can upload songs to the system as an artist and create an album.
Note: Everyone in the system is a user by default. Artists are both users and artists.
